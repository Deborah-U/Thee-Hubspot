## 💡Inspiration

* Being a member of the LGBTQIA+ community comes with a lot of risks for such a crucial period of development. 
* Members of the LGBTQIA+ community are prone to discrimination and hate, there is a lot of vulnerability that comes with it, emotionally and physically—the dangers of being outed or coming out, having difficulty accessing LGBTQ+-specific healthcare, and more. 
* This is, in part, due to a general lack of safety because of poor of education and understanding of LGBTQ+ issues and health, as well as a lack of visible and accessible community. 
* This all translates to a lack of self-confidence and self-acceptance that can harm LGBTQ+ youth & adults.

## 🌈💬What it does

Thëe Ḧubsp̈ot is a web application to empower & celebrate ALL sectors of the LGBTQ+ community via 3 interactive, educational, and expression forms: Triviä Ḧub, Säfe Ḧub, Mediä Ḧub.

* Triviä Ḧub. helps allies and members of the community learn more about different LGBTQ+ topics (i.e. historical events, fun facts, etc.) through interactive daily, fun trivia questions. 
* Säfe Ḧub. provides users with a way to engage with their local LGTBQ+ community in a judgment-free zone. They can ask about anything from favorite coffee shops to the most taboo topics. They can share and express themselves.
* Mediä Ḧub. is where users can be empowered and learn more about fresh TV shows and movies, music, and news celebrating & representing the LGBTQ+ community—tailored to their media platform preferences.

**Validation:** Our application makes the LGBTQIA+ community and other minority groups feel valid by providing trivia questions to all users about various sectors of the LGBTQIA+ community. We also make them feel valid in their identity by having a media hub that shows themselves represented in new & old shows/movies, pieces of music, and other forms of media. All these features allow various members of the LGBTQIA+ community to feel empowered, seen, and represented in the world they live in.

**Self Expression:** Though, in one community (LGBTQIA+), everyone has different identities and experiences with dealing with changes. Our Säfe Ḧub allows our users to express themselves, rant/vent, share fun/sad stories, or any queries they have on any topics!

## 🛠️ How we built it

**Process**

_I used a design thinking framework._

1. Empathize
2. Define the problem
3. Ideate
4. Prototype
5. Test

**Technologies Used**

_Google Docs & Draw_

* We used google docs during the ideating & brainstorming phase.
* We used Google draw to map out features & MVPs.

_Figma_

* We made the design system & branding on Figma (color, typography, etc.).
* Then, we made low & high-fidelity.

## 😤 Challenges we ran into

* Finding teammates to create a project with.
* Trying to learn code and implement my designs into code.
* Working on the hack alone, as I am a beginner.
* Time constraints (Started on June 15)

## 🏆 Accomplishments that we're proud of

* Becoming more educated about issues in the LGBTQ+ community through in-depth user research.
* Creating an application to help educate and inspire young people to learn more about the LGBTQ+ community & make members of the LGBTQ+ Community feel validated and have a place for self-expression.
* Completing this application solo, despite all the above-stated challenges.

## 📖 What we learned

* I learned a lot about the LGBTQ+ community through in-depth user research.
* I not only learned about educational gaps but also aspects of learning that fit the needs of our target audience (Millennials/Gen-Z) in order to create a more user-centric product. 
* I learned more about user personas & user research
* I learned more about app design and UI
* I learned about using my research to create the UX
* I learned about design systems (typography, color, branding, etc.)
* I learned a little bit about HTML & CSS even though we weren’t able to implement them during this hackathon

## 🚀 What's next for _Thëe Ḧubsp̈ot_

Thëe Ḧubsp̈ot does not & will not stop at the end of this hackathon! It will continue with the help of developers & investors. So if you, judge, or hackathon participant know anyone wanting to join in the creation of an LGBTQIA+  app, let me know! **Here's our launch plan:**

**Part I:**

* Finalize platform and educational/forum functionalities.
* Initiate outbound marketing and sales.
* Leverage Gen Z & LGBTQIA+ ambassadors.

**Part II**
* Pilot test in colleges & inclusivity programs
* Integrate user feedback
* Integrate new features
* Monetize further

**Key Tactics (_will be used during the execution in both part I & II_)**
* A/B testing of  our features
* Gradual roll-out (test market)
* Interactive user feedback cycles
